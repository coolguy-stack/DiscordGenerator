# DiscordGenerator

My first project using Discord Bot API. This program pulls random words within the words.txt file which was scraped from an online dictionary
and combines them to make unique usernames/passwords for new users.

In order to run this program, I suggest creating and running your own discord bot first and then linking the source code to your bot.There are
tons of online tutorials that helps you do that.

Thank you for visiting!
